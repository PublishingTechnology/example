    <p>Provides the API for serializing and de-serializing specified Objects into and from XML,
    as well as an implementation ready for use. Objects for serialization need to be tagged 
    with the <code>XmlSerializable</code> interface. Because the <code>XmlSerializer</code> 
    is defined as an interface, developers are not tied to the existing implementation but 
    may extend or substitute others as required merely by providing a new implementation and
    changing the <code>XmlSerializerFactory</code> to return it.</p>
    <p>The code is provided for use with the search component but it is capable of handling
    any/all compatible Java Objects.</p>
